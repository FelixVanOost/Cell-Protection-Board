# Cell-Protection-Board
A PCB to link the cell voltage taps of eight parallel 6S batteries and protect them using fuses.

This project is developed by the [Electric Car Club](http://ubcelectriccar.com/) at the University of British Columbia, whose current goal is to break the world record for the fastest 1/4 mile in a street-legal electric car. The car, named Elektra, is a 1963 Volkswagen Beetle.

----------
Context
----------

Phase I of Elektras' battery pack consists of 30 [Turnigy 22.2V 6S 5Ah](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__38515__Turnigy_Heavy_Duty_Series_5000mAh_6S_60C_Lipo_Pack.html) lithium-ion polymer batteries (originally designed for use in R/C airplanes) arranged in 5 series modules of 6 parallel batteries each. This produces a total nominal pack voltage of 111V with a peak discharge rate of around 2,400A. Phase II will increase the number of parallel batteries in each module from 6 to 8 and will increase the number of modules from 5 to 8 (resulting in a pack capable of around 3,000A peak discharge current at a nominal 177V).

The battery management system (BMS) incorporated into the car monitors the voltage of the individual cells within each battery in the pack and is capable of balancing cells with one another to maintain optimal battery health over time. This is accomplished through the connection of cell voltage taps, which are wired by the battery manufacturer between each cell in every battery. Each of the 6S batteries features 7 cell taps for monitoring and balancing purposes, which are seperate from the positive and negative leads of the battery and do not provide traction power to the car.

Since the 6 batteries in each module (Phase I) are connected together in parallel through copper bussbars, their cell voltage taps will also need to be paralleled together. In this way, the BMS can treat cell 1 of each of the 6 batteries as one large cell, followed by cell 2 and so on. The BMS will therefore only see 6 cells arranged in series, regardless of how many batteries are actually connected together in parallel.

Cell voltage taps play a key component in maintaing battery health over time, as they enable the individual cells to be balanced with one another to accomodate for minuscule variations in chemistry as they are charged and discharged. Cell balancing is handled by the BMS, which burns off excess energy in cells with higher voltage to bring them down to the same voltage as the other cells within the battery. The [Orion BMS](http://www.orionbms.com/) used in Elekta is capable of sustaining a maximum cell balancing current of around 250mA.
